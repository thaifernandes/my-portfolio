I had daily stand-up meetings via video conference with the development and design team in Brazil. I needed a quick MVP (minimum viable product) but ready to scale version of the app. I proposed an initial Sprint to quickly study and run spikes with potential infrastructures and scalable technologies. We collaboratively opted for Elixir and Postgres due to the balance of fast development and scalability. We deployed an interim version of the app every 2 weeks on a Sprint. The prototypes were tested in different times with final users by the UX team in Brazil coordinated by me.</h4>
            <br>
			<h4>I coordinated the design and development changes and prioritized them. I run more than 2 workshops in different stages of the app designing and developing. The user research helped me delimitate and also polish the app. In parallel, I ran different Google Forms to confirm and discover more information about my target needs. In one of my first Google Forms, I got +300 answers in 3 days without any massive web campaign. I also led some discussions at web groups to discover and understand the needs of my target. I was impressed because everybody I talked got super interested in the app, willing to donate their time to help me, and also participate in the workshops, surveys and beta test.</h4>

We worked collaboratively in the same room and we also had daily standup meetings, Sprint Reviews, and Retrospectives. I created briefing templates for each deliverable.

Buscapé is the leader in their segment in LATAM with 30M page views per month. We contacted them and talked about HP’s needs and they offered us to test a pilot of a new type of media.

I solved this problem by keeping track of changes and managing the IT and Design teams to push updates to the Buscapé platform on the fly. I also developed a template which helped the optimization of the changes. As an additional low budget solution, we used HP and their SMBs partner's newsletter base to send emails with the key Black Friday deals. We also created banners on affiliated news websites and Google Adwords to complement, and also use it as an auxiliary media for the campaign.</h4>
